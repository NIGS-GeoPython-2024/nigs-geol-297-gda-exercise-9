# Exercise 9: Comparing data to predictions (20 points)

In this week's exercise we will work on comparing observations (data) to predictions. In particular, we will explore three different ways in which we can compare data to a prediction:

1. Fitting a line to *x-y* data using the *least squares regression*
2. Calculating *linear correlation coefficients* between two variables
3. Comparing observed values to expected values using a *goodness-of-fit* equation

All three of these cases are frequently used, and can even be calculated in commonly used software such as **Microsoft Excel**. Our goal is to understand what the numbers from these "fits" mean and *how* they are calculated.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 9 is due by the start of the next lesson (on 9 November 2024)**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and upload your changes to GitHub after each major change**!

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 9](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L9/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L9/exercise-9.html#general-hints-for-exercise-9) if you're having trouble
- Take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** if you are uncertain about **the style of your code**

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 9 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 9 repository (e.g., `exercise-9-jdaled`) in the instance using Git. If you are unaware of how to do this, you can find instruction in [**Lesson 2**](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).
